## About Libraries at home

Libraries at home brings together information about public library services in the UK, making this easy to find and accessible. It does not replace the use of existing library websites. It provides signposting to the information people are looking for, as quickly as possible.

### Help

A lot of effort went into compiling the data that makes this site possible. The websites for each library service in the UK (205) were checked to find data on social media accounts, important links, library catalogue and eResource suppliers, and more.
