# Libraries at home

This project is a website for exploring data compiled about library services in the UK. The website was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

The project uses npm for dependences and package management. To get started run the following within the project directory.

```
npm install
```

The following script is then also available.

```
npm run start
```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deployment

```
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

```
npm run deploy
```

This deploys the application into the gh-pages branch and pushes that branch. This operation requires admin permission.
